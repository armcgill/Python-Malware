# Ran_somewhere - Educational Python Based Ransomware

## Disclaimer: 
This script should only be used for educational purposes. Don't try
to encrypt anyone elses computer except your own or with explicit permission. 
Don't run any code you don't understand.  

## What is Ransomware: 
Ransomware is a malicious software with the purpose of encrypting data on a device, 
rendering any files on the system unusable. In order to decrypt the data, malicious actors
often demand a ransom in the form of cryptocurrency. 

## Dependancies: 
``` pip install pycryptodome ``` 

## Program Files: 
*GenKey.py* 
  This python program generates the private and public key RSA keys. 
  Make sure to keep track of your private key as this is how you will decrypt your files. 

*Crypt.py* 
    This is the actual ransomware that encrypts all of the data. This starts by encoding  
    the pubic key in base64. This makes it more difficult to identify to analyze through static
    malware analysis. 
    The python iterates through a specified directory and generates an AES key to encrypt
    each file with. The AES key itself it is encrypted with the RSA public key generated
    in the previous file.
    
*Decrypt.py*
    This script recursively decrypts the directories using the private key generated in GenKey.py. 
    It reads the private key from the file; decrypts the session key and then decrypts 
    the data with the session key. It creates a new file with the unencrypted data and then
    deletes the old encrypted one. 

## Features to implement in Ran_Somewhere:

-	Random AES key and IV for each file
-	Encrypt AES keys with client public key (RSA-2048)
-	Encrypt client private key with (RSA-2048) server public key
-	Works without internet
-	Communicate with python webserver to get server private key
-	Changes computer wallpaper
-	Must not be detected by AV 
-	Low memory user
